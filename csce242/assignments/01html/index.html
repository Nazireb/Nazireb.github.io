        <p>Snow leopards are cats that live in the mountains of Central and South Asia. They have thick fur and big paws that help them walk on snow. Their spotted gray fur helps them hide in the rocky land. Snow leopards are shy and like to live alone, so people do not see them very often.</p>
        <p>These animals are in danger because they are losing their homes and food. Some people also hunt them for their fur. Groups are working to protect snow leopards and their land. If we help take care of them, snow leopards can live safely for many years.</p>
